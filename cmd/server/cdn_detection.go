// Issue #1561: detect CDN-fronted deployments and warn ONCE.
//
// When operators put CoreScope behind Cloudflare/Fastly without
// configuring a /api/* cache bypass, dashboards go stale — the origin
// emits Cache-Control: no-store (#1551), but the CDN's zone-level
// caching policy can still cache JSON responses for hours
// (cf-cache-status: HIT, age > 0). We can't fix the CDN config from
// the server side; the best we can do is detect the situation and
// loudly tell the operator at the logs.
//
// Detection: presence of any CDN-specific request header
// (CF-Connecting-IP, CF-Ray, Fastly-Client-IP, True-Client-IP).
// We deliberately exclude X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP: every
// generic reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik, k8s ingress) sets
// those, so including them would warn operators who aren't behind
// a CDN at all and train them to ignore the warning entirely
// (defeating the point of #1561).
//
// Side effects: a single log line per process boot — never blocks
// the request, never modifies the response, never logs again.

// cdnWarned is set true after the first CDN-fronted request has been
// observed and logged. Subsequent requests short-circuit before the
// per-request header scan in firstCDNHeader — a hot-path optimization
// for the steady state (warning already emitted, every /api request
// otherwise pays for 4 http.Header.Get lookups forever).

// cdnHeaders are HTTP request headers injected ONLY by CDNs
// (Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai) — never by a generic reverse proxy.

// X-Forwarded-For / X-Real-IP are intentionally NOT in this list:
// every nginx/Caddy/Traefik/k8s-ingress deployment sets them, so
// using them as a CDN signal produces a false positive on every
// reverse-proxied install (issue #1561 round-1 review).
