# TDD.md — Test-Driven Development is mandatory

You DO NOT write production code without a failing test first. This is non-negotiable.

## The cycle

1. **Red.** Write a test that demonstrates the bug or the new behavior. Commit it. **CI must FAIL on this commit** — that's the proof the test gates the change.
2. **Green.** Write the smallest production code that makes the test pass. Commit it. CI must go GREEN.
3. **Refactor.** (Optional.) Improve clarity, keeping CI green.

### Red commit quality bar

- MUST compile/build successfully (no missing imports, no undefined symbols).
- MUST run the test to completion (not crash before reaching assertions).
- MUST fail on an **assertion** ("expected X, got Y") — NOT a build/import error.
- If the function doesn't exist yet, add a minimal stub (return zero / nil / empty) so the test executes and fails on the assertion.
- **A compile error is NOT a valid red commit** — it proves nothing about behavior gating.

PR commit history must show: red commit → green commit. Reviewers verify this; the merge-gate skill checks it programmatically.

## Exemptions (require explicit justification in PR body)

- **Pure refactors**: existing tests MUST remain byte-unchanged (renames OK, behavior changes NOT) AND green. PR body must cite: "tests/ files diff: no changes" OR per-altered-test justification.
- **Config changes**: existing tests MUST stay green AND unaltered. PR body must cite: "no test files modified" + "CI green without test edits."
- **Net-new UI surfaces** (no prior assertions to break): a test must land in the SAME PR but doesn't need to be the FIRST commit. Bug fixes on EXISTING UI still require red-then-green (E2E-DOM-grep tests are valid).
- **Pure docs / pure comments**: no test required. The Kent-Beck persona gate still runs and rubber-stamps with "no behavior change" justification.

## Rationale

Tests written after the fact are advocacy, not validation. A test that doesn't fail when reverted is not a test — it's a tautology. TDD forces the API to be testable; if you can't write the failing test, the design is wrong — fix the design first.

## What blocks merge

- No red commit on the branch (when not exempt).
- Test commit doesn't actually fail when reverted (Kent-Beck persona verifies).
- Tests added in the same commit as the fix (no red→green visible).
- Test mirrors the implementation rather than asserting behavior (tautology).
- Refactor PR with altered test files lacking explicit justification.
